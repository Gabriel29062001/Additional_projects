## 🌱 About the Project

**Gavithes Foundation** is a non-profit initiative born from a shared passion for adventure, sport, and environmental responsibility.  
In 2021, two lifelong friends set out on an extraordinary journey: cycling from **Alsace (France) to Berlin**, crossing **five European countries** : France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Germany.

For each kilometer traveled, we pledged to **plant one tree per person**.  
By the end of our 1,500 km ride, **3,000 trees** were planted in a forest in **Alsace**, symbolizing our commitment to give back to nature and to inspire others to take action for the planet.
